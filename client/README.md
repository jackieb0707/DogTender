# Dog \Tender

# Description
For people with dogs to have an online website/app to get friends for their dog to play with. A site where dog lovers can come to learn more information about dogs and to also donate to different dog charities in their area. This site is basically a tender for dogs but, it would only be to arrange playtime and or meet new people who also share a liking of dogs.
We used :mongoDB, graphQL, React, Bootstrap, node, heroku.
